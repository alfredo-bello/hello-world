Hello, Alfredo Bello here!  Been in IT for about 12 years.  Started off at Doncar systems doing Oracle and powerbuilder.  Moved over in 2008 to MPI where I did powerbuilder, sql server, informatica, asp.net classic, batch files, unix scripting, stored procedures and integration.  Currently I'm back at the Apptius HQ where I got my C# certification and I'm working towards getting my ASP.NET MVC certification.  I start a contract with IQ Metrix/Solvera on Monday, May 2nd doing C# work!  =D
